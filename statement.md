The traditional game Rock–Paper–Scissors is a simple hand game played between two players, where each player chooses one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on fixed rules:

Rock crushes Scissors

Scissors cuts Paper

Paper covers Rock

In this project, the objective is to develop a Python program that simulates this game between a user and the computer. The program must accept user input, generate a random choice for the computer, compare both choices, determine the winner, and display the result. It should also handle invalid inputs and optionally allow multiple rounds or best-of match modes.

The problem is to design an interactive, user-friendly, and error-free program that correctly implements The scope of this Rock–Paper–Scissors project is to develop a simple, interactive, and efficient Python-based game that allows a user to play against the computer. The project focuses on implementing the core game logic using basic programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, functions, loops, and random number generation.

This project aims to demonstrate:

The ability to convert a real-world game into a computer program.

Handling of user interactions through the command-line interface.

Generating unpredictable computer choices using Python’s random module.

Proper evaluation of game outcomes (win/lose/tie).1. Students and Beginners in Programming

Users who want to learn basic Python concepts such as loops, conditions, functions, and random number generation.

Ideal for school or college students doing Python projects.

✅ 2. Casual Gamers

Anyone who enjoys simple, quick, and fun games.

Users who want a lightweight, time-pass game on the command line.

✅ 3. Teachers / Trainers

Educators who want to demonstrate simple game logic or programming fundamentals.

Useful for teaching input handling, control flow, and modular coding.

✅ 4. Developers Practicing Logic Building

Programmers who want to practice structuring a small project.

Good for learning modular design, problem-solving, and code organization.1. User vs Computer Gameplay

The game allows the user to compete against a computer opponent that makes decisions randomly, creating an unpredictable and engaging experience.

✅ 2. Randomized Computer Decision

The computer’s choice is generated using Python’s random module, ensuring fair and non-biased gameplay.

✅ 3. Input Flexibility

Users can enter choices in multiple formats such as:

r, p, s

rock, paper, scissors

This makes the game simple and user-friendly.

✅ 4. Best-of Match Mode

The program supports a customizable “Best of N rounds” mode. The user can choose how many rounds to play, making the game more competitive and strategic.

✅ 5. Real-Time Score Tracking

After each round, the program displays:

Player score

Computer score

Number of rounds played

This keeps the player informed about the match progress.

✅ 6. Clear Result Feedback

Each round shows:

Player's choice

Computer’s choice

Icons (✊ ✋ ✌️) for better visual experience

Round result (Win / Lose / Tie)

This improves clarity and user engagement.

✅ 7. Input Validation & Error Handling

Invalid inputs are checked and handled gracefully to prevent crashes and guide the user to enter correct values.

✅ 8. Modular Code Structure

The game is divided into multiple modules:

Choices

Game logic

Utilities

Main program

This makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and expand.

✅ 9. Graceful Exit Handling

The program lets the user exit anytime by typing:

q, quit, or exit
and also handles keyboard interrupts safely.

✅ 10. Highly Extensible

The project can be expanded with features like:

GUI interface (Tkinter or Pygame)

Multiplayer mode

Score saving

Online version

✅ 5. Hobbyists

Anyone interested in experimenting with Python or building small console games.

Input validation and error handling.

Support for multiple rounds or best-of match formats.

The project is limited to a text-based (console) version of the game but can be extended in the future to include advanced features such as a graphical user interface (GUI), score tracking, animations, multiplayethe game logic while demonstrating the use of Python concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and the random module.
